Here is the original source code for the *loveletter* *virus*, a historical macro worm released into the wild on 5 May 2000.

When working with all malware (old or new), exercise caution before running any potentially malicious code. This repository is not intended for any malicious use, but simply to act as an educational reference for malware researchers, educators, InfoSec students, and anyone interested in historical code.

The malware is referred to as a virus by the author, however, based on current InfoSec categorization (2021), *loveletter* has more worm properties than virus. For a detailed description of both, [look here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-worms-and-virus/).

[Excerpt from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILOVEYOU#Creation):
> ILOVEYOU was created by Onel De Guzman, a college student in Manila, Philippines, who was 24 years old at the time. De Guzman, who was poor and struggling to pay for Internet access at the time, created the computer worm intending to steal other users' passwords, which he could use to log in to their Internet accounts without needing to pay for the service. He justified his actions on his belief that Internet access is a human right, and that he was not actually stealing.
> 
> The worm used the same principles that de Guzman had described in his undergraduate thesis at AMA Computer College. He stated that the worm was very easy to create, thanks to a bug in Windows 95 that would run code in email attachments when the user clicked on them. Originally designing the worm to only work in Manila, he removed this geographic restriction out of curiosity, which allowed the worm to spread worldwide. De Guzman did not expect this worldwide spread.
